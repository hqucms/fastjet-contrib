-------------------------
Version 1
-------------------------

The initial release of the HOTVR algorithm. The algorithm has been developed by
Tobias Lapsien, Roman Kogler and Johannes Haller (University of Hamburg). 
This release has been tested for top-quark tagging at the LHC. 
Developments and adaptions for W,Z,H tagging are ongoing. 

-- 1.1.0: Considerable speed improvements, especially for high particle multiplicities. 
The clustering uses now the N2Tiled and N2Plain options available from Fastjet 3.2 (and higher). 
For earlier Fastjet versions, the NNH clustering is used as default (similar to version 1.0.0).
The user can now choose the clustering strategy, "Best" is taken as default (dynamically switches 
between the various options, based on the multiplicity, the maximum R and the Fastjet version).
The implementation of the N2Tiled and N2Plain methods is based on the developments of the 
VR algorithm, partially taken and adapted from VariableR/VariableRPlugin.cc, version 1.2.1. 
Many thanks to Gregory Soyez, Nikola Whallon and Jesse Thaler!

-- 1.0.0: release including the algorithm itself (HOTVR) and a helper class
to access additional substructure information (HOTVRinfo). An example program 
is given in example.cc
