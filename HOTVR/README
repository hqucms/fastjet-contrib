The Heavy Object Tagger with Variable R (HOTVR)
-----------------------------------------------

The HOTVR algorithm is based on the physics described in:

   A new tagger for hadronically decaying heavy particles at the LHC

The algorithm has been developed for the reconstruction and identification
of boosted, hadronically decaying heavy particles (W,Z,H,t). For top-quark 
tagging, it is usable in a large range of transverse momentum (pt), from 
100 GeV up to more than 2500 GeV. Studies for W,Z,H tagging are ongoing.

The HOTVR implementation is based on the implementations of the mass jump and
Variable R algorithms in the Fastjet Contribs packages 
ClusteringVetoPlugin 1.0.0 and VariableR 1.1.1, respectively.
These implementations have been adapted and modified to make 
the HOTVR algorithm an independent Fastjet plugin. 
Speed improvements have been achieved using developments by 
Gregory Soyez, Nikola Whallon and Jesse Thaler, done for the 
VariableR version 1.2.1.
