    Update clustering to use the N2Tiled and N2Plain options available in Fastjet 3.2 (and higher).
    If Fastjet version < 3.2, the NNH clustering is used as default. 
    Implementation based on the developments of the VR algorithm, partially taken and adapted from 
	VariableR/VariableRPlugin.cc, version 1.2.1 (thanks to Gregory Soyez, Nikola Whallon and Jesse Thaler).
